# 1. Register for IBM Cloud <a name="part-SETUP-00"></a>

#### Step 3: [Login into IBM Cloud](https://ibm.biz/Bd2JHx) using your account credentials.

_Note:_ By default, all new IBM Cloud accounts are set to a [lite version](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/pricing).

The lite account provides free access to a subset of IBM Cloud resources. Lite accounts **don't need a credit-card** to sign up and they **don't expire** after a certain period of time. 
In order to create a free Kubernetes cluster, you need a **feature code**.

# 2 Insert feature code <a name="part-SETUP-01"></a>

In order to execute the workshop easily, we provide **feature codes** to create free Kubernetes clusters, so no credit card details are required.
To apply the feature code to your [Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com/account), navigate to your "`Account settings`" and then to ("`Manage`" -> "`Account`").
Enter your unique Feature (Promo) Code to upgrade your lite account.

_Note:_ Free clusters expire after one month.

# 3 Create a free Kubernetes Cluster <a name="part-SETUP-02"></a>

#### Step 1: Logon to IBM Cloud

#### Step 2: Select in the menu "Catalog" and search for "Kubernetes Cluster"

#### Step 5: Click on the Kubernetes Services and select "Free"

Ensure you set following values in the creation dialog:

* Cluster name:     cloud-native
* Resource group:   Default
* Geography:        North America
* Metro:            Dallas

_Note:_ In the new IBM Cloud UI it seems the enties for Geography and Metro are no longer available.

#### Step 6: Press "Create custer"

#### Step 7: Now you will be forwarded to your cluster on IBM Cloud and you can verify the status of the creation of your cluster

The creation of the custer takes up to 20 min.

# 3 Configure the IBM Cloud Container Registry <a name="part-SETUP-03"></a>

1. Select in **Kubernetes** the entry **Registry** and ensure your are in the **Dallas location**.

2. The create a namespace with a unique name cloud-native-[YOURNAME]

_Note:_ Namespaces are required to be **unique** across the entire **region** that the **specific registry** is located in, not just ***unique to your account**. This is mentioned in the following [public documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Registry?topic=registry-getting-started#gs_registry_namespace_add).

3. Verify the namespace was created
