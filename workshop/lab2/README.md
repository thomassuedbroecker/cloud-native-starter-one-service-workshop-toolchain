### Lab 2: Insert feature code

In order to execute the workshop easily, we provide **feature codes** to create free Kubernetes clusters, so no credit card details are required. To apply the feature code to your [Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com/account), navigate to your "`Account settings`" and then to \("`Manage`" -&gt; "`Account`"\). Enter your unique Feature \(Promo\) Code to upgrade your lite account.

_Note:_ Free clusters expire after one month.
